3. What is RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and why is it important in C++?
4. Explain how a binary search tree (BST) works and write a function to insert a value into a BST in C++.
5. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy in C++? Can you provide an example where each might be used?
