1. Basic Thread Creation:
Write a C++ program that creates two threads. Each thread should print numbers from 1 to 5.

2. Thread Synchronization with Mutexes:
Write a program where two threads increment a shared integer variable 1000 times each. Use a mutex to ensure that the shared variable is correctly incremented.

3. Producer-Consumer Problem with Condition Variables:
Implement a producer-consumer problem using condition variables. The producer should generate numbers and add them to a queue, and the consumer should remove and print those numbers.

4. Thread Pool Implementation:
Implement a simple thread pool that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. Provide a way to add tasks to the thread pool and get the results.

5. Parallel Algorithms:
Use the parallel version of std::for_each to multiply each element in a vector by 2. Verify that the operation is performed correctly.

6. Avoiding Deadlocks with std::scoped_lock:
Write a program that creates two threads, each trying to lock two mutexes in different orders. Use std::scoped_lock to avoid deadlocks.

7. Shared Lock with std::shared_mutex:
Implement a scenario where multiple threads read from a shared resource using std::shared_mutex and one thread writes to it.

8. Barrier Synchronization:
Use std::barrier to synchronize three threads at a certain point in their execution. Each thread should print a message before and after the barrier.

9. Profiling Multithreaded Code:
Describe the steps you would take to profile a multithreaded application using a tool like Intel VTune. What kind of issues would you look for?

10. Debugging Race Conditions:
Write a multithreaded program that deliberately introduces a race condition. Use ThreadSanitizer to detect the race condition and describe how you would fix it.
